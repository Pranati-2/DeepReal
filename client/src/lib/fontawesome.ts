// This file is used to load FontAwesome from CDN
// We're exporting nothing, this is just to ensure the CSS is loaded 
// when the App component is imported

// In a production app, we might want to load these as actual dependencies
// but for this demo, loading from CDN is simpler and allowed by the instructions

// This is imported by App.tsx to ensure FontAwesome is available
export {};
