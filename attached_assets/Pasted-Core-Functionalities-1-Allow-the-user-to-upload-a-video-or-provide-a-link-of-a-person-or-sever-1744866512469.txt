Core Functionalities:

1. Allow the user to upload a video or provide a link of a person (or several people) speaking.


2. Let the user speak to the character(s) in any language using their microphone.


3. Convert the speech to text using a multilingual speech-to-text model (e.g., OpenAI Whisper or Vosk.js).


4. Analyze the emotion in the user’s voice or words using speech-based or text-based emotion detection (e.g., SpeechBrain or HuggingFace)


5. Identify which character the user is addressing (if multiple are present), and maintain separate LLM-based personas for each one.


6. Send the prompt to a local LLM like Mixtral, OpenBuddy, or MythoMax, preserving context and emotion.The conversation outputted should be based on the content/ transcript of the video and user input


7. Convert the LLM’s text reply to natural speech using Coqui TTS or OpenVoice.


8. Use SadTalker or Wav2Lip to generate a deepfake video response of the character speaking that response.


9. Play back the generated lip-synced video + audio in the browser and let the user continue the conversation.



Architectural Requirements:

Frontend: Use React, support WebRTC for microphone, TailwindCSS for UI, WebAssembly where possible.

Run as much as possible on the client side (minimal backend), using localStorage or IndexedDB for caching.

Each character should have a unique:

Name / backstory

LLM context (prompt memory)

Voice (TTS voice)

Face animation profile


For conversations with multiple characters, use a conversation orchestrator or dialogue manager that supports back-and-forth between characters and user input.


Tech Stack Suggestions:

Frontend: React.js + TailwindCSS + WebRTC + Three.js (optional for rendering heads)

Speech-to-Text: Whisper.cpp (via WebAssembly), Vosk.js

Emotion Detection:

Speech: SpeechBrain, DeepSpectrum

Text: HuggingFace (e.g., j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base)


LLM: Mixtral, OpenBuddy, MythoMax (via LM Studio or Ollama)

TTS: Coqui TTS (multilingual), OpenVoice

Deepfake Animation: SadTalker or Wav2Lip (in browser or via server)

Character Management: LangGraph, Finite-State Machine, or simple orchestrator function

Storage: IndexedDB, in-browser memory for temp files

Optional Enhancements:

Emotion-based voice modulation

Avatar switching

GPT agents (auto-chat between characters)

Export or record conversations
